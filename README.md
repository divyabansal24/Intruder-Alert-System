# Intruder-Alert-System
## Overview
This project is an **Intruder Alert System** using an **Arduino** and a **PIR motion sensor**. The system detects motion and triggers an LED and buzzer alert. This is an ideal project for basic security applications.

## Features
- Motion detection using a **PIR Sensor**
- Alerts via **LED and Serial Monitor**
- Adjustable **trigger time**
- Simple and **cost-effective**

## Components Required
- **Arduino Board** (ESP32, Uno, etc.)
- **PIR Sensor** (HC-SR501)
- **LED**
- **Resistors** (as needed)
- **Wires and Breadboard**

## Setup Instructions
1. Connect the **PIR sensor** and **LED** to the Arduino as per the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the provided **Arduino code** to the board.
3. Open the **Serial Monitor** to observe detection logs.

## Future Improvements
- Add **wireless notifications** (e.g., via WiFi or Bluetooth).
- Integrate with **buzzer alarms** or **home automation systems**.
- Use a **camera module** for enhanced security.
